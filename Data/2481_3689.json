The tree is represented by an array `parent` of size `n`, where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`. Since node 0 is the root, `parent[0] == -1`. You are also given a string `s` of length `n`, where `s[i]` is the character assigned to node `i`. Consider an empty string `dfsStr`, and define a recursive function `dfs(int x)` that takes a node `x` as a parameter and performs the following steps in order: Iterate over each child `y` of `x` **in increasing order of their numbers**, and call `dfs(y)`. Add the character `s[x]` to the end of the string `dfsStr`. **Note** that `dfsStr` is shared across all recursive calls of `dfs`. You need to find a boolean array `answer` of size `n`, where for each index `i` from `0` to `n - 1`, you do the following: Empty the string `dfsStr` and call `dfs(i)`. If the resulting string `dfsStr` is a palindrome, then set `answer[i]` to `true`. Otherwise, set `answer[i]` to `false`. Return the array `answer`. **Example 1:** **Input:** parent = [-1,0,0,1,1,2], s = \"aababa\" **Output:** [true,true,false,true,true,true] **Explanation:** Calling `dfs(0)` results in the string `dfsStr = \"abaaba\"`, which is a palindrome.

Calling `dfs(3)` results in the string `dfsStr = \"a\"`, which is a palindrome. Calling `dfs(4)` results in the string `dfsStr = \"b\"`, which is a palindrome.

In one operation, you can pick any index `i` of `s`, and perform **either one** of the following actions: Shift `s[i]` to the next letter in the alphabet. If `s[i] == 'z'`, you should replace it with `'a'`. This operation costs `nextCost[j]` where `j` is the index of `s[i]` in the alphabet. Shift `s[i]` to the previous letter in the alphabet.

If one player summons a Water Serpent and the other summons a Fire Dragon, the player who summoned the **Water Serpent** is awarded a point. If one player summons an Earth Golem and the other summons a Water Serpent, the player who summoned the **Earth Golem** is awarded a point.

        "task_description": "You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer array `queries`. Let `gcdPairs` denote an array obtained by calculating the GCD of all possible pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])`, where `0 <= i < j < n`, and then sorting these values in **ascending** order. For each query `queries[i]`, you need to find the element at index `queries[i]` in `gcdPairs`. Return an integer array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the value at `gcdPairs[queries[i]]` for each query. The term `gcd(a, b)` denotes the **greatest common divisor** of `a` and `b`. **Example 1:** **Input:** nums = [2,3,4], queries = [0,2,2] **Output:** [1,2,2] **Explanation:** `gcdPairs = [gcd(nums[0], nums[1]), gcd(nums[0], nums[2]), gcd(nums[1], nums[2])] = [1, 2, 1]`. After sorting in ascending order, `gcdPairs = [1, 1, 2]`. So, the answer is `[gcdPairs[queries[0]], gcdPairs[queries[1]], gcdPairs[queries[2]]] = [1, 2, 2]`. **Example 2:** **Input:** nums = [4,4,2,1], queries = [5,3,1,0] **Output:** [4,2,1,1] **Explanation:** `gcdPairs` sorted in ascending order is `[1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4]`. **Example 3:** **Input:** nums = [2,2], queries = [0,0] **Output:** [2,2] **Explanation:** `gcdPairs = [2]`. **Constraints:** `2 <= n == nums.length <= 105` `1 <= nums[i] <= 5 * 104` `1 <= queries.length <= 105` `0 <= queries[i] < n * (n - 1) / 2`",

You are given two integers `kx` and `ky` where `(kx, ky)` denotes the position of the knight, and a 2D array `positions` where `positions[i] = [xi, yi]` denotes the position of the pawns on the chessboard. Alice and Bob play a _turn-based_ game, where Alice goes first. In each player's turn: The player _selects _a pawn that still exists on the board and captures it with the knight in the **fewest** possible **moves**. **Note** that the player can select **any** pawn, it **might not** be one that can be captured in the **least** number of moves. In the process of capturing the _selected_ pawn, the knight **may** pass other pawns **without** capturing them. **Only** the _selected_ pawn can be captured in _this_ turn. Alice is trying to **maximize** the **sum** of the number of moves made by _both_ players until there are no more pawns on the board, whereas Bob tries to **minimize** them. Return the **maximum** _total_ number of moves made during the game that Alice can achieve, assuming both players play **optimally**.

Second query: Count of the alternating groups with size 4: **Example 2:** **Input:** colors = [0,0,1,0,1,1], queries = [[1,3],[2,3,0],[1,5]] **Output:** [2,0] **Explanation:** First query: Count of the alternating groups with size 3: Second query: `colors` will not change. Third query: There is no alternating group with size 5. **Constraints:** `4 <= colors.length <= 5 * 104` `0 <= colors[i] <= 1` `1 <= queries.length <= 5 * 104` `queries[i][0] == 1` or `queries[i][0] == 2` For all `i` that: `queries[i][0] == 1`: `queries[i].length == 2`, `3 <= queries[i][1] <= colors.length - 1` `queries[i][0] == 2`: `queries[i].length == 3`, `0 <= queries[i][1] <= colors.length - 1`, `0 <= queries[i][2] <= 1`",

Return an integer representing the **minimum** number of seconds required for the workers to make the height of the mountain 0. **Example 1:** **Input:** mountainHeight = 4, workerTimes = [2,1,1] **Output:** 3 **Explanation:** One way the height of the mountain can be reduced to 0 is: Worker 0 reduces the height by 1, taking `workerTimes[0] = 2` seconds. Worker 1 reduces the height by 2, taking `workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 = 3` seconds. Worker 2 reduces the height by 1, taking `workerTimes[2] = 1` second. Since they work simultaneously, the minimum time needed is `max(2, 3, 1) = 3` seconds. **Example 2:** **Input:** mountainHeight = 10, workerTimes = [3,2,2,4] **Output:** 12 **Explanation:** Worker 0 reduces the height by 2, taking `workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 = 9` seconds. Worker 1 reduces the height by 3, taking `workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 + workerTimes[1] * 3 = 12` seconds. Worker 2 reduces the height by 3, taking `workerTimes[2] + workerTimes[2] * 2 + workerTimes[2] * 3 = 12` seconds. Worker 3 reduces the height by 2, taking `workerTimes[3] + workerTimes[3] * 2 = 12` seconds. The number of seconds needed is `max(9, 12, 12, 12) = 12` seconds. **Example 3:** **Input:** mountainHeight = 5, workerTimes = [1] **Output:** 15 **Explanation:** There is only one worker in this example, so the answer is `workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 + workerTimes[0] * 3 + workerTimes[0] * 4 + workerTimes[0] * 5 = 15`. **Constraints:** `1 <= mountainHeight <= 105` `1 <= workerTimes.length <= 104` `1 <= workerTimes[i] <= 106`",

Return `true` if such a path exists, and `false` otherwise. **Example 1:** **Input:** xCorner = 3, yCorner = 4, circles = [[2,1,1]] **Output:** true **Explanation:** The black curve shows a possible path between `(0, 0)` and `(3, 4)`. **Example 2:** **Input:** xCorner = 3, yCorner = 3, circles = [[1,1,2]] **Output:** false **Explanation:** No path exists from `(0, 0)` to `(3, 3)`. **Example 3:** **Input:** xCorner = 3, yCorner = 3, circles = [[2,1,1],[1,2,1]] **Output:** false **Explanation:** No path exists from `(0, 0)` to `(3, 3)`. **Example 4:** **Input:** xCorner = 4, yCorner = 4, circles = [[5,5,1]] **Output:** true **Explanation:** **Constraints:** `3 <= xCorner, yCorner <= 109` `1 <= circles.length <= 1000` `circles[i].length == 3` `1 <= xi, yi, ri <= 109`",

        "task_description": "You are given an integer array `nums` with length `n`. The **cost** of a subarray `nums[l..r]`, where `0 <= l <= r < n`, is defined as: `cost(l, r) = nums[l] - nums[l + 1] + ... + nums[r] * (\u22121)r \u2212 l` Your task is to **split** `nums` into subarrays such that the **total** **cost** of the subarrays is **maximized**, ensuring each element belongs to **exactly one** subarray. Formally, if `nums` is split into `k` subarrays, where `k > 1`, at indices `i1, i2, ..., ik \u2212 1`, where `0 <= i1 < i2 < ... < ik - 1 < n - 1`, then the total cost will be: `cost(0, i1) + cost(i1 + 1, i2) + ... + cost(ik \u2212 1 + 1, n \u2212 1)` Return an integer denoting the _maximum total cost_ of the subarrays after splitting the array optimally. **Note:** If `nums` is not split into subarrays, i.e. `k = 1`, the total cost is simply `cost(0, n - 1)`. **Example 1:** **Input:** nums = [1,-2,3,4] **Output:** 10 **Explanation:** One way to maximize the total cost is by splitting `[1, -2, 3, 4]` into subarrays `[1, -2, 3]` and `[4]`. The total cost will be `(1 + 2 + 3) + 4 = 10`. **Example 2:** **Input:** nums = [1,-1,1,-1] **Output:** 4 **Explanation:** One way to maximize the total cost is by splitting `[1, -1, 1, -1]` into subarrays `[1, -1]` and `[1, -1]`. The total cost will be `(1 + 1) + (1 + 1) = 4`. **Example 3:** **Input:** nums = [0] **Output:** 0 **Explanation:** We cannot split the array further, so the answer is 0. **Example 4:** **Input:** nums = [1,-1] **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** Selecting the whole array gives a total cost of `1 + 1 = 2`, which is the maximum. **Constraints:** `1 <= nums.length <= 105` `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`",

A **subarray** is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array. **Example 1:** **Input:** nums = [1,2,4,5], k = 3 **Output:** 0 **Explanation:** The subarray `nums[0..1]` has `OR` value 3, which gives the minimum absolute difference `|3 - 3| = 0`. **Example 2:** **Input:** nums = [1,3,1,3], k = 2 **Output:** 1 **Explanation:** The subarray `nums[1..1]` has `OR` value 3, which gives the minimum absolute difference `|3 - 2| = 1`. **Example 3:** **Input:** nums = [1], k = 10 **Output:** 9 **Explanation:** There is a single subarray with `OR` value 1, which gives the minimum absolute difference `|10 - 1| = 9`. **Constraints:** `1 <= nums.length <= 105` `1 <= nums[i] <= 109` `1 <= k <= 109`",

You are given a 2D array `queries`, which contains two types of queries: For a query of type 1, `queries[i] = [1, x]`. Build an obstacle at distance `x` from the origin. It is guaranteed that there is **no** obstacle at distance `x` when the query is asked. For a query of type 2, `queries[i] = [2, x, sz]`. Check if it is possible to place a block of size `sz` _anywhere_ in the range `[0, x]` on the line, such that the block **entirely** lies in the range `[0, x]`. A block **cannot **be placed if it intersects with any obstacle, but it may touch it. Note that you do** not** actually place the block. Queries are separate.

So the total sum of digit differences between all pairs of integers is `1 + 1 + 2 = 4`. **Example 2:** **Input:** nums = [10,10,10,10] **Output:** 0 **Explanation:** All the integers in the array are the same. So the total sum of digit differences between all pairs of integers will be 0. **Constraints:** `2 <= nums.length <= 105` `1 <= nums[i] < 109` All integers in `nums` have the same number of digits.",

        "task_description": "There is an undirected graph of `n` nodes. You are given a 2D array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, lengthi]` describes an edge between node `ui` and node `vi` with a traversal time of `lengthi` units. Additionally, you are given an array `disappear`, where `disappear[i]` denotes the time when the node `i` disappears from the graph and you won't be able to visit it. **Note** that the graph might be _disconnected_ and might contain _multiple edges_. Return the array `answer`, with `answer[i]` denoting the **minimum** units of time required to reach node `i` from node 0. If node `i` is **unreachable** from node 0 then `answer[i]` is `-1`. **Example 1:** **Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1,2],[1,2,1],[0,2,4]], disappear = [1,1,5] **Output:** [0,-1,4] **Explanation:** We are starting our journey from node 0, and our goal is to find the minimum time required to reach each node before it disappears. For node 0, we don't need any time as it is our starting point. For node 1, we need at least 2 units of time to traverse `edges[0]`. Unfortunately, it disappears at that moment, so we won't be able to visit it.

We define a function `greaterCount` such that `greaterCount(arr, val)` returns the number of elements in `arr` that are **strictly greater** than `val`. You need to distribute all the elements of `nums` between two arrays `arr1` and `arr2` using `n` operations. In the first operation, append `nums[1]` to `arr1`. In the second operation, append `nums[2]` to `arr2`. Afterwards, in the `ith` operation: If `greaterCount(arr1, nums[i]) > greaterCount(arr2, nums[i])`, append `nums[i]` to `arr1`. If `greaterCount(arr1, nums[i]) < greaterCount(arr2, nums[i])`, append `nums[i]` to `arr2`. If `greaterCount(arr1, nums[i]) == greaterCount(arr2, nums[i])`, append `nums[i]` to the array with a **lesser** number of elements. If there is still a tie, append `nums[i]` to `arr1`. The array `result` is formed by concatenating the arrays `arr1` and `arr2`. For example, if `arr1 == [1,2,3]` and `arr2 == [4,5,6]`, then `result = [1,2,3,4,5,6]`. Return _the integer array_ `result`. **Example 1:** ``` **Input:** nums = [2,1,3,3] **Output:** [2,3,1,3] **Explanation:** After the first 2 operations, arr1 = [2] and arr2 = [1]. In the 3rd operation, the number of elements greater than 3 is zero in both arrays. Also, the lengths are equal, hence, append nums[3] to arr1. In the 4th operation, the number of elements greater than 3 is zero in both arrays. As the length of arr2 is lesser, hence, append nums[4] to arr2. After 4 operations, arr1 = [2,3] and arr2 = [1,3]. Hence, the array result formed by concatenation is [2,3,1,3]. ``` **Example 2:** ``` **Input:** nums = [5,14,3,1,2] **Output:** [5,3,1,2,14] **Explanation:** After the first 2 operations, arr1 = [5] and arr2 = [14]. In the 3rd operation, the number of elements greater than 3 is one in both arrays. Also, the lengths are equal, hence, append nums[3] to arr1.

In the 5th operation, the number of elements greater than 2 is greater in arr1 than arr2 (2 > 1). Hence, append nums[5] to arr1. After 5 operations, arr1 = [5,3,1,2] and arr2 = [14]. Hence, the array result formed by concatenation is [5,3,1,2,14]. ``` **Example 3:** ``` **Input:** nums = [3,3,3,3] **Output:** [3,3,3,3] **Explanation:** At the end of 4 operations, arr1 = [3,3] and arr2 = [3,3].

You are given the integer `n` and an array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi]` indicates that there is an edge between vertices `ui` and `vi` with a weight of `wi`. A walk on a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges. The walk starts and ends with a vertex, and each edge connects the vertex that comes before it and the vertex that comes after it. It's important to note that a walk may visit the same edge or vertex more than once. The **cost** of a walk starting at node `u` and ending at node `v` is defined as the bitwise `AND` of the weights of the edges traversed during the walk. In other words, if the sequence of edge weights encountered during the walk is `w0, w1, w2, ..., wk`, then the cost is calculated as `w0 & w1 & w2 & ... & wk`, where `&` denotes the bitwise `AND` operator. You are also given a 2D array `query`, where `query[i] = [si, ti]`. For each query, you need to find the minimum cost of the walk starting at vertex `si` and ending at vertex `ti`. If there exists no such walk, the answer is `-1`. Return _the array _`answer`_, where _`answer[i]`_ denotes the **minimum** cost of a walk for query _`i`. **Example 1:** **Input:** n = 5, edges = [[0,1,7],[1,3,7],[1,2,1]], query = [[0,3],[3,4]] **Output:** [1,-1] **Explanation:** To achieve the cost of 1 in the first query, we need to move on the following edges: `0->1` (weight 7), `1->2` (weight 1), `2->1` (weight 1), `1->3` (weight 7). In the second query, there is no walk between nodes 3 and 4, so the answer is -1. **Example 2:** **Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,2,7],[0,1,15],[1,2,6],[1,2,1]], query = [[1,2]] **Output:** [0] **Explanation:** To achieve the cost of 0 in the first query, we need to move on the following edges: `1->2` (weight 1), `2->1` (weight 6), `1->2` (weight 1). **Constraints:** `2 <= n <= 105` `0 <= edges.length <= 105` `edges[i].length == 3` `0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1` `ui != vi` `0 <= wi <= 105` `1 <= query.length <= 105` `query[i].length == 2` `0 <= si, ti <= n - 1` `si != ti`",

You are given two 2D integer arrays `bottomLeft` and `topRight` where `bottomLeft[i] = [a_i, b_i]` and `topRight[i] = [c_i, d_i]` represent the **bottom-left** and **top-right** coordinates of the `ith` rectangle, respectively. You need to find the **maximum** area of a **square** that can fit inside the intersecting region of at least two rectangles. Return `0` if such a square does not exist. **Example 1:** **Input:** bottomLeft = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,1]], topRight = [[3,3],[4,4],[6,6]] **Output:** 1 **Explanation:** A square with side length 1 can fit inside either the intersecting region of rectangles 0 and 1 or the intersecting region of rectangles 1 and 2.

Your task is to mark **all** indices in `nums`. In each second, `s`, in order from `1` to `m` (**inclusive**), you can perform **one** of the following operations: Choose an index `i` in the range `[1, n]` and **decrement** `nums[i]` by `1`. If `nums[changeIndices[s]]` is **equal** to `0`, **mark** the index `changeIndices[s]`. Do nothing. Return _an integer denoting the **earliest second** in the range _`[1, m]`_ when **all** indices in _`nums`_ can be marked by choosing operations optimally, or _`-1`_ if it is impossible._ **Example 1:** ``` **Input:** nums = [2,2,0], changeIndices = [2,2,2,2,3,2,2,1] **Output:** 8 **Explanation:** In this example, we have 8 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices: Second 1: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums becomes [1,2,0]. Second 2: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums becomes [0,2,0]. Second 3: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [0,1,0]. Second 4: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [0,0,0]. Second 5: Mark the index changeIndices[5], which is marking index 3, since nums[3] is equal to 0. Second 6: Mark the index changeIndices[6], which is marking index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0. Second 7: Do nothing. Second 8: Mark the index changeIndices[8], which is marking index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0. Now all indices have been marked. It can be shown that it is not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 8th second. Hence, the answer is 8. ``` **Example 2:** ``` **Input:** nums = [1,3], changeIndices = [1,1,1,2,1,1,1] **Output:** 6 **Explanation:** In this example, we have 7 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices: Second 1: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [1,2]. Second 2: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [1,1]. Second 3: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [1,0]. Second 4: Mark the index changeIndices[4], which is marking index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0. Second 5: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums becomes [0,0]. Second 6: Mark the index changeIndices[6], which is marking index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0. Now all indices have been marked. It can be shown that it is not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 6th second. Hence, the answer is 6. ``` **Example 3:** ``` **Input:** nums = [0,1], changeIndices = [2,2,2] **Output:** -1 **Explanation:** In this example, it is impossible to mark all indices because index 1 isn't in changeIndices.

We define the **right** direction as positive x-axis (**increasing x-coordinate**) and the **left** direction as negative x-axis (**decreasing x-coordinate**). Similarly, we define the **up** direction as positive y-axis (**increasing y-coordinate**) and the **down** direction as negative y-axis (**decreasing y-coordinate**) You have to place `n` people, including Alice and Bob, at these points such that there is **exactly one** person at every point. Alice wants to be alone with Bob, so Alice will build a rectangular fence with Alice's position as the **upper left corner** and Bob's position as the **lower right corner** of the fence (**Note** that the fence **might not** enclose any area, i.e. it can be a line). If any person other than Alice and Bob is either **inside** the fence or **on** the fence, Alice will be sad. Return _the number of **pairs of points** where you can place Alice and Bob, such that Alice **does not** become sad on building the fence_. **Note** that Alice can only build a fence with Alice's position as the upper left corner, and Bob's position as the lower right corner. For example, Alice cannot build either of the fences in the picture below with four corners `(1, 1)`, `(1, 3)`, `(3, 1)`, and `(3, 3)`, because: With Alice at `(3, 3)` and Bob at `(1, 1)`, Alice's position is not the upper left corner and Bob's position is not the lower right corner of the fence. With Alice at `(1, 3)` and Bob at `(1, 1)`, Bob's position is not the lower right corner of the fence. **Example 1:** ``` **Input:** points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]] **Output:** 0 **Explanation:** There is no way to place Alice and Bob such that Alice can build a fence with Alice's position as the upper left corner and Bob's position as the lower right corner. Hence we return 0. ``` **Example 2:** ``` **Input:** points = [[6,2],[4,4],[2,6]] **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** There are two ways to place Alice and Bob such that Alice will not be sad: - Place Alice at (4, 4) and Bob at (6, 2). - Place Alice at (2, 6) and Bob at (4, 4). You cannot place Alice at (2, 6) and Bob at (6, 2) because the person at (4, 4) will be inside the fence. ``` **Example 3:** ``` **Input:** points = [[3,1],[1,3],[1,1]] **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** There are two ways to place Alice and Bob such that Alice will not be sad: - Place Alice at (1, 1) and Bob at (3, 1). - Place Alice at (1, 3) and Bob at (1, 1). You cannot place Alice at (1, 3) and Bob at (3, 1) because the person at (1, 1) will be on the fence. Note that it does not matter if the fence encloses any area, the first and second fences in the image are valid. ``` **Constraints:** `2 <= n <= 1000` `points[i].length == 2` `-109 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 109` All `points[i]` are distinct.",

        "task_description": "You are given `m x n` grid `image` which represents a grayscale image, where `image[i][j]` represents a pixel with intensity in the range `[0..255]`. You are also given a **non-negative** integer `threshold`. Two pixels are **adjacent** if they share an edge. A **region** is a `3 x 3` subgrid where the **absolute difference** in intensity between any two **adjacent** pixels is **less than or equal to** `threshold`. All pixels in a region belong to that region, note that a pixel can belong to **multiple** regions. You need to calculate a `m x n` grid `result`, where `result[i][j]` is the **average** intensity of the regions to which `image[i][j]` belongs, **rounded down** to the nearest integer. If `image[i][j]` belongs to multiple regions, `result[i][j]` is the **average **of the** rounded-down average **intensities of these regions, **rounded down** to the nearest integer. If `image[i][j]` does** not** belong to any region, `result[i][j]` is **equal to** `image[i][j]`. Return the grid `result`. **Example 1:** **Input:** image = [[5,6,7,10],[8,9,10,10],[11,12,13,10]], threshold = 3 **Output:** [[9,9,9,9],[9,9,9,9],[9,9,9,9]] **Explanation:** There are two regions as illustrated above. The average intensity of the first region is 9, while the average intensity of the second region is 9.67 which is rounded down to 9. The average intensity of both of the regions is (9 + 9) / 2 = 9. As all the pixels belong to either region 1, region 2, or both of them, the intensity of every pixel in the result is 9. Please note that the rounded-down values are used when calculating the average of multiple regions, hence the calculation is done using 9 as the average intensity of region 2, not 9.67. **Example 2:** **Input:** image = [[10,20,30],[15,25,35],[20,30,40],[25,35,45]], threshold = 12 **Output:** [[25,25,25],[27,27,27],[27,27,27],[30,30,30]] **Explanation:** There are two regions as illustrated above. The average intensity of the first region is 25, while the average intensity of the second region is 30. The average intensity of both of the regions is (25 + 30) / 2 = 27.5 which is rounded down to 27. All the pixels in row 0 of the image belong to region 1, hence all the pixels in row 0 in the result are 25. Similarly, all the pixels in row 3 in the result are 30. The pixels in rows 1 and 2 of the image belong to region 1 and region 2, hence their assigned value is 27 in the result. **Example 3:** **Input:** image = [[5,6,7],[8,9,10],[11,12,13]], threshold = 1 **Output:** [[5,6,7],[8,9,10],[11,12,13]] **Explanation:** There is only one `3 x 3` subgrid, while it does not have the condition on difference of adjacent pixels, for example, the difference between `image[0][0]` and `image[1][0]` is `|5 - 8| = 3 > threshold = 1`.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum** points you can get in the end by optimally performing operations. **Example 1:** **Input:** enemyEnergies = [3,2,2], currentEnergy = 2 **Output:** 3 **Explanation:** The following operations can be performed to get 3 points, which is the maximum: First operation on enemy 1: `points` increases by 1, and `currentEnergy` decreases by 2. So, `points = 1`, and `currentEnergy = 0`. Second operation on enemy 0: `currentEnergy` increases by 3, and enemy 0 is marked. So, `points = 1`, `currentEnergy = 3`, and marked enemies = `[0]`. First operation on enemy 2: `points` increases by 1, and `currentEnergy` decreases by 2. So, `points = 2`, `currentEnergy = 1`, and marked enemies = `[0]`. Second operation on enemy 2: `currentEnergy` increases by 2, and enemy 2 is marked. So, `points = 2`, `currentEnergy = 3`, and marked enemies = `[0, 2]`. First operation on enemy 1: `points` increases by 1, and `currentEnergy` decreases by 2. So, `points = 3`, `currentEnergy = 1`, and marked enemies = `[0, 2]`. **Example 2:** **Input:** enemyEnergies = [2], currentEnergy = 10 **Output:** 5 **Explanation: ** Performing the first operation 5 times on enemy 0 results in the maximum number of points. **Constraints:** `1 <= enemyEnergies.length <= 105` `1 <= enemyEnergies[i] <= 109` `0 <= currentEnergy <= 109`",

Your task is to **minimize** the length of `nums` by performing the following operations **any** number of times (including zero): Select **two** **distinct** indices `i` and `j` from `nums`, such that `nums[i] > 0` and `nums[j] > 0`. Insert the result of `nums[i] % nums[j]` at the end of `nums`. Delete the elements at indices `i` and `j` from `nums`. Return _an integer denoting the **minimum** **length** of _`nums`_ after performing the operation any number of times._ **Example 1:** ``` **Input:** nums = [1,4,3,1] **Output:** 1 **Explanation:** One way to minimize the length of the array is as follows: Operation 1: Select indices 2 and 1, insert nums[2] % nums[1] at the end and it becomes [1,4,3,1,3], then delete elements at indices 2 and 1. nums becomes [1,1,3]. Operation 2: Select indices 1 and 2, insert nums[1] % nums[2] at the end and it becomes [1,1,3,1], then delete elements at indices 1 and 2. nums becomes [1,1]. Operation 3: Select indices 1 and 0, insert nums[1] % nums[0] at the end and it becomes [1,1,0], then delete elements at indices 1 and 0. nums becomes [0]. The length of nums cannot be reduced further. Hence, the answer is 1. It can be shown that 1 is the minimum achievable length. ``` **Example 2:** ``` **Input:** nums = [5,5,5,10,5] **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** One way to minimize the length of the array is as follows: Operation 1: Select indices 0 and 3, insert nums[0] % nums[3] at the end and it becomes [5,5,5,10,5,5], then delete elements at indices 0 and 3. nums becomes [5,5,5,5]. Operation 2: Select indices 2 and 3, insert nums[2] % nums[3] at the end and it becomes [5,5,5,5,0], then delete elements at indices 2 and 3. nums becomes [5,5,0].

You are also given two **0-indexed** string arrays `original` and `changed`, and an integer array `cost`, where `cost[i]` represents the cost of converting the string `original[i]` to the string `changed[i]`. You start with the string `source`. In one operation, you can pick a **substring** `x` from the string, and change it to `y` at a cost of `z` **if** there exists **any** index `j` such that `cost[j] == z`, `original[j] == x`, and `changed[j] == y`. You are allowed to do **any** number of operations, but any pair of operations must satisfy **either** of these two conditions: The substrings picked in the operations are `source[a..b]` and `source[c..d]` with either `b < c` **or** `d < a`. In other words, the indices picked in both operations are **disjoint**. The substrings picked in the operations are `source[a..b]` and `source[c..d]` with `a == c` **and** `b == d`. In other words, the indices picked in both operations are **identical**. Return _the **minimum** cost to convert the string _`source`_ to the string _`target`_ using **any** number of operations_. _If it is impossible to convert_ `source` _to_ `target`,_ return_ `-1`. **Note** that there may exist indices `i`, `j` such that `original[j] == original[i]` and `changed[j] == changed[i]`. **Example 1:** ``` **Input:** source = \"abcd\", target = \"acbe\", original = [\"a\",\"b\",\"c\",\"c\",\"e\",\"d\"], changed = [\"b\",\"c\",\"b\",\"e\",\"b\",\"e\"], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20] **Output:** 28 **Explanation:** To convert \"abcd\" to \"acbe\", do the following operations: - Change substring source[1..1] from \"b\" to \"c\" at a cost of 5. - Change substring source[2..2] from \"c\" to \"e\" at a cost of 1. - Change substring source[2..2] from \"e\" to \"b\" at a cost of 2. - Change substring source[3..3] from \"d\" to \"e\" at a cost of 20.

Now The longest prefix containing at most 2 distinct characters is `\"bc\"`, so we remove it and `s` becomes `\"a\"`. Finally, we remove `\"a\"` and `s` becomes empty, so the procedure ends. Doing the operations, the string is divided into 3 partitions, so the answer is 3. **Example 2:** **Input:** s = \"aabaab\", k = 3 **Output:** 1 **Explanation:** Initially `s` contains 2 distinct characters, so whichever character we change, it will contain at most 3 distinct characters, so the longest prefix with at most 3 distinct characters would always be all of it, therefore the answer is 1. **Example 3:** **Input:** s = \"xxyz\", k = 1 **Output:** 4 **Explanation:** The optimal way is to change `s[0]` or `s[1]` to something other than characters in `s`, for example, to change `s[0]` to `w`. Then `s` becomes `\"wxyz\"`, which consists of 4 distinct characters, so as `k` is 1, it will divide into 4 partitions. **Constraints:** `1 <= s.length <= 104` `s` consists only of lowercase English letters. `1 <= k <= 26`",

You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree. You are also given a **0-indexed** integer array `cost` of length `n`, where `cost[i]` is the **cost** assigned to the `ith` node. You need to place some coins on every node of the tree. The number of coins to be placed at node `i` can be calculated as: If size of the subtree of node `i` is less than `3`, place `1` coin. Otherwise, place an amount of coins equal to the **maximum** product of cost values assigned to `3` distinct nodes in the subtree of node `i`. If this product is **negative**, place `0` coins. Return _an array _`coin`_ of size _`n`_ such that _`coin[i]`_ is the number of coins placed at node _`i`_._ **Example 1:** ``` **Input:** edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5]], cost = [1,2,3,4,5,6] **Output:** [120,1,1,1,1,1] **Explanation:** For node 0 place 6 * 5 * 4 = 120 coins.

For example, if the given array is `[1,3,5,6]` and you select subarray `[3,5]` the array will convert to `[1,8,6]`. Return _the _**_maximum_**_ length of a _**_non-decreasing_**_ array that can be made after applying operations._ A **subarray** is a contiguous **non-empty** sequence of elements within an array. **Example 1:** ``` **Input:** nums = [5,2,2] **Output:** 1 **Explanation:** This array with length 3 is not non-decreasing. We have two ways to make the array length two. First, choosing subarray [2,2] converts the array to [5,4]. Second, choosing subarray [5,2] converts the array to [7,2]. In these two ways the array is not non-decreasing. And if we choose subarray [5,2,2] and replace it with [9] it becomes non-decreasing. So the answer is 1. ``` **Example 2:** ``` **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4] **Output:** 4 **Explanation:** The array is non-decreasing. So the answer is 4. ``` **Example 3:** ``` **Input:** nums = [4,3,2,6] **Output:** 3 **Explanation:** Replacing [3,2] with [5] converts the given array to [4,5,6] that is non-decreasing.

        "task_description": "You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` having an **even** length `n`. You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array, `queries`, where `queries[i] = [ai, bi, ci, di]`. For each query `i`, you are allowed to perform the following operations: Rearrange the characters within the **substring** `s[ai:bi]`, where `0 <= ai <= bi < n / 2`. Rearrange the characters within the **substring** `s[ci:di]`, where `n / 2 <= ci <= di < n`. For each query, your task is to determine whether it is possible to make `s` a **palindrome** by performing the operations. Each query is answered **independently** of the others. Return _a **0-indexed** array _`answer`_, where _`answer[i] == true`_ if it is possible to make _`s`_ a palindrome by performing operations specified by the _`ith`_ query, and _`false`_ otherwise._ A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. `s[x:y]` represents the substring consisting of characters from the index `x` to index `y` in `s`, **both inclusive**. **Example 1:** ``` **Input:** s = \"abcabc\", queries = [[1,1,3,5],[0,2,5,5]] **Output:** [true,true] **Explanation:** In this example, there are two queries: In the first query: - a0 = 1, b0 = 1, c0 = 3, d0 = 5. - So, you are allowed to rearrange s[1:1] => abcabc and s[3:5] => abcabc. - To make s a palindrome, s[3:5] can be rearranged to become => abccba. - Now, s is a palindrome. So, answer[0] = true. In the second query: - a1 = 0, b1 = 2, c1 = 5, d1 = 5. - So, you are allowed to rearrange s[0:2] => abcabc and s[5:5] => abcabc. - To make s a palindrome, s[0:2] can be rearranged to become => cbaabc. - Now, s is a palindrome. So, answer[1] = true. ``` **Example 2:** ``` **Input:** s = \"abbcdecbba\", queries = [[0,2,7,9]] **Output:** [false] **Explanation:** In this example, there is only one query. a0 = 0, b0 = 2, c0 = 7, d0 = 9. So, you are allowed to rearrange s[0:2] => abbcdecbba and s[7:9] => abbcdecbba. It is not possible to make s a palindrome by rearranging these substrings because s[3:6] is not a palindrome. So, answer[0] = false. ``` **Example 3:** ``` **Input:** s = \"acbcab\", queries = [[1,2,4,5]] **Output:** [true] **Explanation: **In this example, there is only one query. a0 = 1, b0 = 2, c0 = 4, d0 = 5. So, you are allowed to rearrange s[1:2] => acbcab and s[4:5] => acbcab. To make s a palindrome s[1:2] can be rearranged to become abccab. Then, s[4:5] can be rearranged to become abccba. Now, s is a palindrome. So, answer[0] = true. ``` **Constraints:** `2 <= n == s.length <= 105` `1 <= queries.length <= 105` `queries[i].length == 4` `ai == queries[i][0], bi == queries[i][1]` `ci == queries[i][2], di == queries[i][3]` `0 <= ai <= bi < n / 2` `n / 2 <= ci <= di < n ` `n` is even. `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.",

In an operation, you select an index `i` in the range `[0, n - 1]` and **swap** the values of `nums1[i]` and `nums2[i]`. Your task is to find the **minimum** number of operations required to satisfy the following conditions: `nums1[n - 1]` is equal to the **maximum value** among all elements of `nums1`, i.e., `nums1[n - 1] = max(nums1[0], nums1[1], ..., nums1[n - 1])`. `nums2[n - 1]` is equal to the **maximum** **value** among all elements of `nums2`, i.e., `nums2[n - 1] = max(nums2[0], nums2[1], ..., nums2[n - 1])`.

You are also given a **0-indexed** array `coins` of size `n` where `coins[i]` indicates the number of coins in the vertex `i`, and an integer `k`. Starting from the root, you have to collect all the coins such that the coins at a node can only be collected if the coins of its ancestors have been already collected. Coins at `nodei` can be collected in one of the following ways: Collect all the coins, but you will get `coins[i] - k` points.

We need to find for each `-1` the respective positive integer, which we call the last visited integer. To achieve this goal, let's define two empty arrays: `seen` and `ans`. Start iterating from the beginning of the array `nums`. If a positive integer is encountered, prepend it to the **front** of `seen`. If `-1` is encountered, let `k` be the number of **consecutive** `-1`s seen so far (including the current `-1`), If `k` is less than or equal to the length of `seen`, append the `k`-th element of `seen` to `ans`. If `k` is strictly greater than the length of `seen`, append `-1` to `ans`. Return the array_ _`ans`. **Example 1:** **Input:** nums = [1,2,-1,-1,-1] **Output:** [2,1,-1] **Explanation:** Start with `seen = []` and `ans = []`. Process `nums[0]`: The first element in nums is `1`. We prepend it to the front of `seen`. Now, `seen == [1]`. Process `nums[1]`: The next element is `2`. We prepend it to the front of `seen`. Now, `seen == [2, 1]`. Process `nums[2]`: The next element is `-1`. This is the first occurrence of `-1`, so `k == 1`. We look for the first element in seen. We append `2` to `ans`. Now, `ans == [2]`. Process `nums[3]`: Another `-1`. This is the second consecutive `-1`, so `k == 2`. The second element in `seen` is `1`, so we append `1` to `ans`. Now, `ans == [2, 1]`. Process `nums[4]`: Another `-1`, the third in a row, making `k = 3`. However, `seen` only has two elements (`[2, 1]`). Since `k` is greater than the number of elements in `seen`, we append `-1` to `ans`. Finally, `ans == [2, 1, -1]`. **Example 2:** **Input:** nums = [1,-1,2,-1,-1] **Output:** [1,2,1] **Explanation:** Start with `seen = []` and `ans = []`. Process `nums[0]`: The first element in nums is `1`. We prepend it to the front of `seen`. Now, `seen == [1]`. Process `nums[1]`: The next element is `-1`. This is the first occurrence of `-1`, so `k == 1`. We look for the first element in `seen`, which is `1`. Append `1` to `ans`. Now, `ans == [1]`. Process `nums[2]`: The next element is `2`. Prepend this to the front of `seen`. Now, `seen == [2, 1]`. Process `nums[3]`: The next element is `-1`. This `-1` is not consecutive to the first `-1` since `2` was in between. Thus, `k` resets to `1`. The first element in `seen` is `2`, so append `2` to `ans`. Now, `ans == [1, 2]`. Process `nums[4]`: Another `-1`. This is consecutive to the previous `-1`, so `k == 2`. The second element in `seen` is `1`, append `1` to `ans`. Finally, `ans == [1, 2, 1]`. **Constraints:** `1 <= nums.length <= 100` `nums[i] == -1` or `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`",

Your task is to select the **longest alternating** subsequence from `words`. A subsequence of `words` is alternating if for any two consecutive strings in the sequence, their corresponding elements in the binary array `groups` differ. Essentially, you are to choose strings such that adjacent elements have non-matching corresponding bits in the `groups` array. Formally, you need to find the longest subsequence of an array of indices `[0, 1, ..., n - 1]` denoted as `[i0, i1, ..., ik-1]`, such that `groups[ij] != groups[ij+1]` for each `0 <= j < k - 1` and then find the words corresponding to these indices.

There are `n` different types of metals available, and you have access to `k` machines that can be used to create alloys. Each machine requires a specific amount of each metal type to create an alloy. For the `ith` machine to create an alloy, it needs `composition[i][j]` units of metal of type `j`. Initially, you have `stock[i]` units of metal type `i`, and purchasing one unit of metal type `i` costs `cost[i]` coins. Given integers `n`, `k`, `budget`, a **1-indexed** 2D array `composition`, and **1-indexed** arrays `stock` and `cost`, your goal is to **maximize** the number of alloys the company can create while staying within the budget of `budget` coins. **All alloys must be created with the same machine.** Return _the maximum number of alloys that the company can create_. **Example 1:** ``` **Input:** n = 3, k = 2, budget = 15, composition = [[1,1,1],[1,1,10]], stock = [0,0,0], cost = [1,2,3] **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** It is optimal to use the 1st machine to create alloys.

You are given the integer `n` and a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` with weight `wi` in the tree. You are also given a 2D integer array `queries` of length `m`, where `queries[i] = [ai, bi]`. For each query, find the **minimum number of operations** required to make the weight of every edge on the path from `ai` to `bi` equal. In one operation, you can choose any edge of the tree and change its weight to any value. **Note** that: Queries are **independent** of each other, meaning that the tree returns to its **initial state** on each new query. The path from `ai` to `bi` is a sequence of **distinct** nodes starting with node `ai` and ending with node `bi` such that every two adjacent nodes in the sequence share an edge in the tree.

Let `f(c)` denote the number of times the character `c` occurs in `s`. The **beauty** of a **k-subsequence** is the **sum** of `f(c)` for every character `c` in the k-subsequence. For example, consider `s = \"abbbdd\"` and `k = 2`: `f('a') = 1`, `f('b') = 3`, `f('d') = 2` Some k-subsequences of `s` are: `\"**ab**bbdd\"` -> `\"ab\"` having a beauty of `f('a') + f('b') = 4` `\"**a**bbb**d**d\"` -> `\"ad\"` having a beauty of `f('a') + f('d') = 3` `\"a**b**bb**d**d\"` -> `\"bd\"` having a beauty of `f('b') + f('d') = 5` Return _an integer denoting the number of k-subsequences __whose **beauty** is the **maximum** among all **k-subsequences**_.

You have to maximize your score by applying the following operation at most `k` times: Choose any **non-empty** subarray `nums[l, ..., r]` that you haven't chosen previously. Choose an element `x` of `nums[l, ..., r]` with the highest **prime score**. If multiple such elements exist, choose the one with the smallest index. Multiply your score by `x`. Here, `nums[l, ..., r]` denotes the subarray of `nums` starting at index `l` and ending at the index `r`, both ends being inclusive. The **prime score** of an integer `x` is equal to the number of distinct prime factors of `x`. For example, the prime score of `300` is `3` since `300 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 * 5`.

In one move, you can move to any adjacent cell in the grid, including cells containing thieves.

Return _the final string that will be present on your laptop screen._ **Example 1:** ``` **Input:** s = \"string\" **Output:** \"rtsng\" **Explanation:** After typing first character, the text on the screen is \"s\". After the second character, the text is \"st\". After the third character, the text is \"str\". Since the fourth character is an 'i', the text gets reversed and becomes \"rts\". After the fifth character, the text is \"rtsn\". After the sixth character, the text is \"rtsng\". Therefore, we return \"rtsng\". ``` **Example 2:** ``` **Input:** s = \"poiinter\" **Output:** \"ponter\" **Explanation:** After the first character, the text on the screen is \"p\". After the second character, the text is \"po\". Since the third character you type is an 'i', the text gets reversed and becomes \"op\".

Return the _**minimum** number of letter changes_ required_._ A **semi-palindrome** is a special type of string that can be divided into **palindromes** based on a repeating pattern. To check if a string is a semi-palindrome:\u200b Choose a positive divisor `d` of the string's length. `d` can range from `1` up to, but not including, the string's length. For a string of length `1`, it does not have a valid divisor as per this definition, since the only divisor is its length, which is not allowed. For a given divisor `d`, divide the string into groups where each group contains characters from the string that follow a repeating pattern of length `d`. Specifically, the first group consists of characters at positions `1`, `1 + d`, `1 + 2d`, and so on; the second group includes characters at positions `2`, `2 + d`, `2 + 2d`, etc. The string is considered a semi-palindrome if each of these groups forms a palindrome. Consider the string `\"abcabc\"`: The length of `\"abcabc\"` is `6`. Valid divisors are `1`, `2`, and `3`. For `d = 1`: The entire string `\"abcabc\"` forms one group. Not a palindrome. For `d = 2`: Group 1 (positions `1, 3, 5`): `\"acb\"` Group 2 (positions `2, 4, 6`): `\"bac\"` Neither group forms a palindrome. For `d = 3`: Group 1 (positions `1, 4`): `\"aa\"` Group 2 (positions `2, 5`): `\"bb\"` Group 3 (positions `3, 6`): `\"cc\"` All groups form palindromes. Therefore, `\"abcabc\"` is a semi-palindrome. **Example 1: ** **Input: ** s = \"abcac\", k = 2 **Output: ** 1 **Explanation: ** Divide `s` into `\"ab\"` and `\"cac\"`. `\"cac\"` is already semi-palindrome.

Each needs one change to become semi-palindrome. **Example 3: ** **Input: ** s = \"aabbaa\", k = 3 **Output: ** 0 **Explanation: ** Divide `s` into substrings `\"aa\"`, `\"bb\"` and `\"aa\"`.

Return _an array _`answer`_ where _`answer[i]`_ is the answer to the _`ith`_ query._ **Example 1:** ``` **Input:** nums1 = [4,3,1,2], nums2 = [2,4,9,5], queries = [[4,1],[1,3],[2,5]] **Output:** [6,10,7] **Explanation:** For the 1st query `xi = 4` and `yi = 1`, we can select index `j = 0` since `nums1[j] >= 4` and `nums2[j] >= 1`. The sum `nums1[j] + nums2[j]` is 6, and we can show that 6 is the maximum we can obtain.

Some edges have a weight of `-1` (`wi = -1`), while others have a **positive** weight (`wi > 0`).

The robots will move a unit distance each second. You are given a string `s` denoting the direction in which robots will move on command. `'L'` means the robot will move towards the left side or negative side of the number line, whereas `'R'` means the robot will move towards the right side or positive side of the number line. If two robots collide, they will start moving in opposite directions. Return _the sum of distances between all the pairs of robots _`d` _seconds after the command. _Since the sum can be very large, return it modulo `109 + 7`. Note: For two robots at the index `i` and `j`, pair `(i,j)` and pair `(j,i)` are considered the same pair. When robots collide, they **instantly change** their directions without wasting any time. Collision happens when two robots share the same place in a moment. For example, if a robot is positioned in 0 going to the right and another is positioned in 2 going to the left, the next second they'll be both in 1 and they will change direction and the next second the first one will be in 0, heading left, and another will be in 2, heading right.

Return _the sum of the **power** of all **non-empty** groups of heroes possible._ Since the sum could be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`. **Example 1:** ``` **Input:** nums = [2,1,4] **Output:** 141 **Explanation:** 1st group: [2] has power = 22 * 2 = 8. 2nd group: [1] has power = 12 * 1 = 1. 3rd group: [4] has power = 42 * 4 = 64. 4th group: [2,1] has power = 22 * 1 = 4. 5th group: [2,4] has power = 42 * 2 = 32. 6th group: [1,4] has power = 42 * 1 = 16. \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b7th group: [2,1,4] has power = 42\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b * 1 = 16. The sum of powers of all groups is 8 + 1 + 64 + 4 + 32 + 16 + 16 = 141. ``` **Example 2:** ``` **Input:** nums = [1,1,1] **Output:** 7 **Explanation:** A total of 7 groups are possible, and the power of each group will be 1.

The root of the tree is node `1` and each node `i` in the tree has two children where the left child is the node `2 * i` and the right child is `2 * i + 1`. Each node in the tree also has a **cost** represented by a given **0-indexed** integer array `cost` of size `n` where `cost[i]` is the cost of node `i + 1`.

Each node has an associated price. You are given an integer array `price`, where `price[i]` is the price of the `ith` node.

        "task_description": "You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. The **concatenation** of two numbers is the number formed by concatenating their numerals. For example, the concatenation of `15`, `49` is `1549`. The **concatenation value** of `nums` is initially equal to `0`. Perform this operation until `nums` becomes empty: If there exists more than one number in `nums`, pick the first element and last element in `nums` respectively and add the value of their concatenation to the **concatenation value** of `nums`, then delete the first and last element from `nums`. If one element exists, add its value to the **concatenation value** of `nums`, then delete it. Return_ the concatenation value of the `nums`_. **Example 1:** ``` **Input:** nums = [7,52,2,4] **Output:** 596 **Explanation:** Before performing any operation, nums is [7,52,2,4] and concatenation value is 0. - In the first operation: We pick the first element, 7, and the last element, 4. Their concatenation is 74, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 74. Then we delete them from nums, so nums becomes equal to [52,2]. - In the second operation: We pick the first element, 52, and the last element, 2. Their concatenation is 522, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 596. Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes empty. Since the concatenation value is 596 so the answer is 596. ``` **Example 2:** ``` **Input:** nums = [5,14,13,8,12] **Output:** 673 **Explanation:** Before performing any operation, nums is [5,14,13,8,12] and concatenation value is 0. - In the first operation: We pick the first element, 5, and the last element, 12. Their concatenation is 512, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 512. Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes equal to [14,13,8]. - In the second operation: We pick the first element, 14, and the last element, 8. Their concatenation is 148, and we add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 660. Then we delete them from the nums, so nums becomes equal to [13]. - In the third operation: nums has only one element, so we pick 13 and add it to the concatenation value, so it becomes equal to 673. Then we delete it from nums, so nums become empty. Since the concatenation value is 673 so the answer is 673. ``` **Constraints:** `1 <= nums.length <= 1000` `1 <= nums[i] <= 104`",

The tree is represented as a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree. Alice wants Bob to find the root of the tree. She allows Bob to make several **guesses** about her tree.

You are given the two integers `n` and `k`, and a 2D integer array `time` of size `k x 4` where `time[i] = [righti, picki, lefti, puti]`. The warehouses are separated by a river and connected by a bridge. Initially, all `k` workers are waiting on the left side of the bridge. To move the boxes, the `ith` worker can do the following: Cross the bridge to the right side in `righti` minutes. Pick a box from the right warehouse in `picki` minutes. Cross the bridge to the left side in `lefti` minutes. Put the box into the left warehouse in `puti` minutes. The `ith` worker is **less efficient** than the j`th` worker if either condition is met: `lefti + righti > leftj + rightj` `lefti + righti == leftj + rightj` and `i > j` The following rules regulate the movement of the workers through the bridge: Only one worker can use the bridge at a time. When the bridge is unused prioritize the **least efficient** worker (who have picked up the box) on the right side to cross. If not, prioritize the **least efficient** worker on the left side to cross. If enough workers have already been dispatched from the left side to pick up all the remaining boxes, **no more** workers will be sent from the left side. Return the **elapsed minutes** at which the last box reaches the **left side of the bridge**. **Example 1:** **Input:** n = 1, k = 3, time = [[1,1,2,1],[1,1,3,1],[1,1,4,1]] **Output:** 6 **Explanation:** ``` From 0 to 1 minutes: worker 2 crosses the bridge to the right.

Each power station can provide power to every city in a fixed **range**. In other words, if the range is denoted by `r`, then a power station at city `i` can provide power to all cities `j` such that `|i - j| <= r` and `0 <= i, j <= n - 1`. Note that `|x|` denotes **absolute** value. For example, `|7 - 5| = 2` and `|3 - 10| = 7`. The **power** of a city is the total number of power stations it is being provided power from.

        "task_description": "There is an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, rooted at node `0`. You are given a 2D integer array `edges` of length `n - 1` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree. At every node `i`, there is a gate. You are also given an array of even integers `amount`, where `amount[i]` represents: the price needed to open the gate at node `i`, if `amount[i]` is negative, or, the cash reward obtained on opening the gate at node `i`, otherwise. The game goes on as follows: Initially, Alice is at node `0` and Bob is at node `bob`. At every second, Alice and Bob each move to an adjacent node. Alice moves towards some **leaf node**, while Bob moves towards node `0`. For **every** node along their path, Alice and Bob either spend money to open the gate at that node, or accept the reward. Note that: If the gate is **already open**, no price will be required, nor will there be any cash reward. If Alice and Bob reach the node **simultaneously**, they share the price/reward for opening the gate there. In other words, if the price to open the gate is `c`, then both Alice and Bob pay `c / 2` each. Similarly, if the reward at the gate is `c`, both of them receive `c / 2` each. If Alice reaches a leaf node, she stops moving. Similarly, if Bob reaches node `0`, he stops moving. Note that these events are **independent** of each other. Return_ the **maximum** net income Alice can have if she travels towards the optimal leaf node._ **Example 1:** ``` **Input:** edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]], bob = 3, amount = [-2,4,2,-4,6] **Output:** 6 **Explanation:** The above diagram represents the given tree. The game goes as follows: - Alice is initially on node 0, Bob on node 3. They open the gates of their respective nodes. Alice's net income is now -2. - Both Alice and Bob move to node 1. Since they reach here simultaneously, they open the gate together and share the reward. Alice's net income becomes -2 + (4 / 2) = 0. - Alice moves on to node 3. Since Bob already opened its gate, Alice's income remains unchanged. Bob moves on to node 0, and stops moving. - Alice moves on to node 4 and opens the gate there. Her net income becomes 0 + 6 = 6. Now, neither Alice nor Bob can make any further moves, and the game ends. It is not possible for Alice to get a higher net income. ``` **Example 2:** ``` **Input:** edges = [[0,1]], bob = 1, amount = [-7280,2350] **Output:** -7280 **Explanation:** Alice follows the path 0->1 whereas Bob follows the path 1->0. Thus, Alice opens the gate at node 0 only. Hence, her net income is -7280. ``` **Constraints:** `2 <= n <= 105` `edges.length == n - 1` `edges[i].length == 2` `0 <= ai, bi < n` `ai != bi` `edges` represents a valid tree. `1 <= bob < n` `amount.length == n` `amount[i]` is an **even** integer in the range `[-104, 104]`.",

Each resulting part should have the suffix `\"<a/b>\"`, where `\"b\"` is to be **replaced** with the total number of parts and `\"a\"` is to be **replaced** with the index of the part, starting from `1` and going up to `b`. Additionally, the length of each resulting part (including its suffix) should be **equal** to `limit`, except for the last part whose length can be **at most** `limit`. The resulting parts should be formed such that when their suffixes are removed and they are all concatenated **in order**, they should be equal to `message`. Also, the result should contain as few parts as possible. Return_ the parts _`message`_ would be split into as an array of strings_.

The next 5 parts take 2 characters each to finish splitting message. In this example, each part, including the last, has length 9.

        "task_description": "There are some robots and factories on the X-axis. You are given an integer array `robot` where `robot[i]` is the position of the `ith` robot. You are also given a 2D integer array `factory` where `factory[j] = [positionj, limitj]` indicates that `positionj` is the position of the `jth` factory and that the `jth` factory can repair at most `limitj` robots. The positions of each robot are **unique**. The positions of each factory are also **unique**. Note that a robot can be **in the same position** as a factory initially. All the robots are initially broken; they keep moving in one direction. The direction could be the negative or the positive direction of the X-axis. When a robot reaches a factory that did not reach its limit, the factory repairs the robot, and it stops moving. **At any moment**, you can set the initial direction of moving for **some** robot. Your target is to minimize the total distance traveled by all the robots. Return _the minimum total distance traveled by all the robots_. The test cases are generated such that all the robots can be repaired. **Note that** All robots move at the same speed. If two robots move in the same direction, they will never collide. If two robots move in opposite directions and they meet at some point, they do not collide. They cross each other. If a robot passes by a factory that reached its limits, it crosses it as if it does not exist. If the robot moved from a position `x` to a position `y`, the distance it moved is `|y - x|`. **Example 1:** ``` **Input:** robot = [0,4,6], factory = [[2,2],[6,2]] **Output:** 4 **Explanation:** As shown in the figure: - The first robot at position 0 moves in the positive direction. It will be repaired at the first factory. - The second robot at position 4 moves in the negative direction. It will be repaired at the first factory. - The third robot at position 6 will be repaired at the second factory. It does not need to move. The limit of the first factory is 2, and it fixed 2 robots. The limit of the second factory is 2, and it fixed 1 robot. The total distance is |2 - 0| + |2 - 4| + |6 - 6| = 4. It can be shown that we cannot achieve a better total distance than 4. ``` **Example 2:** ``` **Input:** robot = [1,-1], factory = [[-2,1],[2,1]] **Output:** 2 **Explanation:** As shown in the figure: - The first robot at position 1 moves in the positive direction. It will be repaired at the second factory. - The second robot at position -1 moves in the negative direction. It will be repaired at the first factory. The limit of the first factory is 1, and it fixed 1 robot. The limit of the second factory is 1, and it fixed 1 robot. The total distance is |2 - 1| + |(-2) - (-1)| = 2. It can be shown that we cannot achieve a better total distance than 2. ``` **Constraints:** `1 <= robot.length, factory.length <= 100` `factory[j].length == 2` `-109 <= robot[i], positionj <= 109` `0 <= limitj <= robot.length` The input will be generated such that it is always possible to repair every robot.",

You want to destroy the **maximum** number of targets in `nums`. Return_ the **minimum value** of _`nums[i]`_ you can seed the machine with to destroy the maximum number of targets._ **Example 1:** ``` **Input:** nums = [3,7,8,1,1,5], space = 2 **Output:** 1 **Explanation:** If we seed the machine with nums[3], then we destroy all targets equal to 1,3,5,7,9,...
